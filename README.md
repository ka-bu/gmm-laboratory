## Generation of Artificial Data Sets

We generate data sets by drawing points according to randomly generated GMMs. However, we control
the following four properties of the GMMs:
1. Gaussian components can either be spherical or elliptical. We describe
the eccentricity of the k-th covariance matrix by 

   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e_k&space;=&space;\frac{\max_d&space;\lambda_{kd}}{\min_d&space;\lambda_{kd}}" title="e_k = \frac{\max_d \lambda_{kd}}{\min_d \lambda_{kd}}" />
   
   
   where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{kd}" title="\lambda_{kd}" /> denotes the d-th eigenvalue of the k-th covariance matrix. 
2.  Components can have different sizes, in terms of the smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding
covariance matrices.
3. The components can have (very) different or uniform mixture weights.
4. The components can overlap more or less. Following the work of [Sanjoy Dasgupta: Learning Mixtures of Gaussians. FOCS 1999: 634-644], we define the separation parameter as follows:

   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c&space;=&space;\min\left\{\frac{\Vert&space;\mu_l&space;-&space;\mu_k&space;\Vert&space;}{&space;\sqrt{\max\left\{\mbox{trace}(\Sigma_l),\mbox{trace}(\Sigma_k)\right\}}&space;}&space;\,\middle|\,&space;k,l\in[K],\&space;k\neq&space;l&space;\right\}" title="c = \min\left\{\frac{\Vert \mu_l - \mu_k \Vert }{ \sqrt{\max\left\{\mbox{trace}(\Sigma_l),\mbox{trace}(\Sigma_k)\right\}} } \,\middle|\, k,l\in[K],\ k\neq l \right\}" />

With these properties of a GMMs in mind, we generate the parameters of a GMM as follows: Initially,we draw K mean vectors independently uniformly at random from a cube with a fixed side length. For the weights, we fix some weight constant W â‰¥ 0, construct a set of weights 

   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left\{&space;2^{c_w\cdot&space;i}/\sum_{j=1}^K&space;2^{c_w\cdot&space;j}&space;\,\middle&space;|&space;\,&space;{i=1,\ldots,K}\right\}" title="\left\{ 2^{c_w\cdot i}/\sum_{j=1}^K 2^{c_w\cdot j} \,\middle | \, {i=1,\ldots,K}\right\}" />
   
and assign these weights randomly to the components. To control the sizes and the eccentricity, we fix a minimum and maximum
eigenvalue and draw the remaining values uniformly at random from the interval between them. Then, we draw a random orthonormal matrix Q and set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\Sigma_k&space;=Q^T\mbox{diag}(\lambda_{k1}^2,\ldots,\lambda_{kD}^2)Q$" title="$\Sigma_k =Q^T\mbox{diag}(\lambda_{k1}^2,\ldots,\lambda_{kD}^2)Q$" />.  
Finally, the mean vectors are scaled as to fit the predefined separation parameter c.
